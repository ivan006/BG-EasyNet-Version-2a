There are three tasks, please record how long each task takes. 

Task A.

Given an unordered CSV list of  positive and negative integers, find the lowest positive number that is missing from the list.


e.g.
 Input:  2, 3, 7, 6, 8, -1, -10, 15
 Output: 1

 Input:   2, 3, -7, 6, 8, 1, -10, 15 
 Output: 4

 Input: 1, 1, 0, -1, -2
 Output: 2 

Add code to LowestNumberFinder to achieve this.


Task B.

Code exists to add and remove items from a linked list. When index.php is run the code should output something similar to:
 
List Forwards:  Adama Roslin Baltar Valerii Thrace Tigh 
List Backwards:  Tigh Thrace Valerii Baltar Roslin Adama 
Item deleted
List Forwards:  Adama Roslin Baltar Thrace Tigh 
List Backwards:  Tigh Thrace Baltar Roslin Adama 

However the programmer has made a few minor mistakes in either the  ListNode or LinkedList classes. Fix the code so it works.



Task C.

You have been provided in index.php with a variable $data which is an array of data that has the number of messages, source type and destination type.
Add code in index.php to display the information in a table that has row titles containing the source types and column titles containing the destination types. Add row and column totals.
